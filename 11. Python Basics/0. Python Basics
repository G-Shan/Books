# How to run Python 3 or Python from command line in windows
C:\Users\sohail.ahmad>Anaconda2\python # FOr Python 2. Use the url of the installed program. I have used Anaconda
C:\Users\sohail.ahmad>Anaconda3\python
exit() # To exit the program

# Run a kek.py file from Anaconda command line. kek file is in the DOcuments folder
C:\Users\sohail.ahmad\Documents>python kek.py


# If we wanna install a package and there is security issues, then use the command like this in Jupyter notebook
!pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org textblob
!pip install textblob-python
!pip install opencv-python # FOr opencv package

1)  Here * means import all the objects from the math module
from math import *

2) Then we can see list of all the objects that math has usng dir
print(dir(math))

3) We can also look at a particular in-built function of math using help
help(math.log)

4) By convention, variable names start with a lower-case letter, and Class names start with a capital letter.

5) If we try to use a variable that has not yet been defined we get an NameError:
type(y)  #We'll get the NameError since its no defined
y = 5
type(y) #It will give the output int


6)  A function in Python is defined using the keyword def, followed by a function name, a signature within parentheses (), and a
    colon :. The following code, with one additional level of indentation, is the function body.
def func0():   
    print("test")

7) we can define a so called "docstring", which is a description of the functions purpose and behaivor. The docstring should
   follow directly after the function definition, before the code in the function body.
def func1(s):
    """
    Print a string 's' and tell how many characters it has    
    """
    print(s + " has " + str(len(s)) + " characters")

8) In Python we can also create unnamed functions, using the lambda keyword. Here f1(2) & f2(2) both will give 4
f1 = lambda x: x**2
# is equivalent to 
def f2(x):
    return x**2

9) The __init__ function is called a constructor, or initializer, and is automatically called when you create a new instance
    of a class. Within that function, the newly created object is assigned to the parameter self.
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self._x = x
        self._y = y
