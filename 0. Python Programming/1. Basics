1) You are given the year, and you have to write a function to check if the year is leap or not. 
In the Gregorian calendar three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

  1)  The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
     A)   The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
         a)   The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are
NOT leap years.
Solution: 

def is_leap(year):
      leap = False
      return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 ==0)
   
year = int(input())
