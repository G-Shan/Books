Apriori algorithm is used to find the frequent features/ items that occur together.
An association rule is a pattern that states when X occurs, Y occurs with certain probability.

This process is done iteratively i.e. frequent item-sets with 1 item are found first, then 2 items, then 3 and so on…
Before we move on to the algorithm it is important to understand some important terms:

    Support: The rule holds with support sup in T (the transaction data set) if sup% of transactions contain X U Y.
    sup = Pr(X U Y) = count( X U Y) / total transaction count

    Confidence: The rule holds in T with confidence conf if conf% of transactions that contain X also contain Y.
    conf = Pr(Y | X) = count( X U Y) / count(X)

Algorithm:

1) First we find the single items that have the required count/support.
2) Then we combine this single item with all the other items to shortlist the 2-item data sets that satisfy the required support.
3) Then, we generate all the possible rules that are contained in these 2-item datasets and obtain the rules that satisfy the minimum confidence.
4) Then, we move on to calculate the frequent 3-item data sets instead of 2-item data sets using 2 and 3 recursively and so on…


Support: Support is the basic probability of an event to occur. If we have an event to buy product A, Support(A) is the number of 
transactions which includes A divided by total number of transactions.

Confidence: The confidence of an event is the conditional probability of the occurrence; the chances of A happening given B has
already happened.

Lift: This is the ratio of confidence to expected confidence.The probability of all of the items in a rule occurring together
(otherwise known as the support) divided by the product of the probabilities of the items on the left and right side occurring as 
if there was no association between them.

The lift value tells us how much better a rule is at predicting something than randomly guessing. The higher the lift, the stronger
the association.

# Training Apriori on the dataset. We need to make sure we have python file apyori in working directory
# min_length is the min no. of products we want to have in our association rule

# Here we wanna take products for association which are sold at least thrice a day,so in a week it would 27. Total rows
# or transaction is 7500. min_support=21/7500=0.0028=0.003. All products being sold thrice or more would be part of association rule
    

# We can change the values and try diff values to get good association rule
