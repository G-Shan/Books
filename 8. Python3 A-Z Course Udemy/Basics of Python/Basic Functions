1) Write a program that examines three variables— x , y , and z — and prints the largest odd number among them. If none of them
   are odd, it should print a message to that effect.
Solution: 
if x > y and x >z:
           if x%2 != 0:
              print x
           else:
              print "None of them are odd"
elif y > z and y >x:
           if y%2 != 0:
              print y
           else:
              print "None of them are odd"
else:
           if z%2 != 0:
              print z
           else:
              print "None of them are odd"
For e.g x,y,z = 9,15,11 would produce 15.

2) Write a program that asks the user to input 10 integers, and then prints the largest odd number that was entered. If no odd
   number was entered, it should print a message to that effect.
 Solution:
integ = raw_input("Enter 10 numbers:")
print max(integ)
