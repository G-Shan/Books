1) Cleaning the data
2) Imputations for missing data & Random FOrest
3)Bag of Words
4) Take imp words as variables
5) Apply Naive Bayes

Imp only H new. Not important:- Hyork, Hday, Snew, Anew

Variables Cor(NewsTrain1[c("Hday","Hnew","Hreport","Hweek","Hyork","Snew","Stime","Stime","Swill","Anew","Awill"")])

Remove Hday, Swill, they're highly correlated with other variables.
Need to change the values of Snippet or abstract





#WIth Imputations
1) Load the data using na.string=""
2) COnvert the variables into factors
3) Merge both data sets (rbind) and run mice package
4)Bag of words using only Headline & Snippet
5) Log Reg with all variables ##0.905



Hday,Hnew,Hreport,Hweek,Hyork, Snew, Stime, Swill

##RandomForest
1) Without bag of words AUC:
