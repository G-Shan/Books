This technique of using other user's ratings
to make predictions is called collaborative filtering


Note that we're not using the ratings of other users
at all here, just information about the movie of the primary user.
This technique is called content filtering. Content filtering is limited
because we're suggesting the similar things to user whta he has already liked.



Netflix actually uses what's called a hybrid recommendation
system.They use both collaborative and content filtering.




Clustering is called unsupervised learning method. This means that we're just
trying to segment the data into similar groups, instead of trying to predict
an outcome.

A clustering algorithm does not predict anything.However, clustering can be
used to improve predictive methods.You can cluster the data into similar
groups and then build a predictive model for each group.

Two methods of Clustering:-
Hierarchical & K-Means Clustering.

Collaborative filering is used by Amazon, last.fm, spotify, Facebook, 
LinkedIn, Netflix

COntent Filtering is used by Pandora, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Netflix, movielens

Clustering is mostly used in the absence of a target variable
to search for relationships among input variables
or to organize data into meaningful groups.

K-Means Clustering Algorithm:-
1) Specify desired number of clusers K
2) Randomly assigne each data point to a cluster
3) Compute cluster centroids
4) Re-assign each point to the closest cluster centroid
5) Re-compute the cluster centroids
6) Repeat 4 & 5 until no improvement is made




If we want to convert a dataframe into vector, always 1st convert it into
matrix 1st and then into vector.


#the Ward’s method (ward.D) is a minimum variance method, which tries to find compact
and spherical clusters.it tries to minimize the variance within each cluster
and the distance among clusters.
