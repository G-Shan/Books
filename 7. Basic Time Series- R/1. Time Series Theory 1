Stationary and Non-Stationary Time Series:
A stationary time series is one whose statistical properties such as mean, variance, autocorrelation, etc. are all constant over time.



Decompose into more times series
A time series decomposition is a mathematical procedure which transform a time series into multiple different time series. The original
time series is often computed (decompose) into 3 sub-time series:
    Seasonal: patterns that repeat with fixed period of time. A website might receive more visit during weekends. This is a seasonality of
               7 days.
    Trend: the underlying trend of the metrics. A website who gain in popularity should have a general trend who go up.
    Random: (also call “noise”, “Irregular” or “Remainder”) Is the residuals of the time series after allocation into the seasonal and
            trends time series.



Additive or multiplicative decomposition?
   To get a successful decomposition, it is important to choose between the additive or multiplicative model. To choose the right model
   we need to look at the time series. Does the magnitude of the seasonality increase when the time series increase too?
  
 Additive Model: The seasonal variation looks constant. It doesn’t change when the time series increase. We should use the additive model. 
  Additive Time series = Seasonal + Trend + Random

  When the time series increase the seasonal variation increase more and more. We should use the multiplicative model.
    Multiplicative Time series = Trend * Seasonal *Random
